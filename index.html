            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Chawanrat Noonamkam, or you can just call me "Cee". 
                I am a Business Information Systems student at the University of East Anglia.
                Currently, I am in my second year and seeking a placement (a year in industry), 
                which is a requirement of my course, and to gain experience in the fields of computer science, IT, and business. 
                Based on this, I decided to create my own website to show my abilities and all the skills I possess. 
            </p>

            <button type="button">Projects</button>
            </a>
            <p>This section will showcase my completed personal projects. 
                Additionally, it will serve as a space to gather my future project collections.  
                It will express how I create and design it, including the outcome of the project or the final work.</p>

            <button type="button">Certificates</button>
            </a>
            <p>Certificates represent my curiosity and enthusiasm for learning. 
                Each course I complete strengthens my understanding of technology 
                and helps me develop the practical skills needed to thrive in a fast-changing digital world.</p>
